# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators
I feel very confident in my ability to use the operators learned so far. I would like to experiment more with these operators to see if I can achieve the same results with different methods of comparison operator use. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I'm confident in my ability to effectively use logical operators. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
If statements in this course is a refresher for me, though I am happy to knock the rust off. Things that I have learned in the past are starting to comeback into my mind.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I took my time with these problems, but I believe it took me around 45 minutes to have all problems in a workable order.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I would like to experiment with using different comparison operators to complete the same problem. I have time set aside to complete this.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have no pressing questions that I haven't been able to answer myself, though the pairing sessions would be a great time to compare experience with my group members.
